THE CONTENTS OF THIS FOLDER IS A VARIETY OF SAMPLE
PROGRAMS FOR HOW TO USE VARIOUS ASPECTS OF X16 BASIC.

-----------------------------------------------------

PER THE CONVENTION DECIDED FOR THIS SD MEDIA:

.BASL ARE BASLOAD EXAMPLES

YOU RUN LOAD THEM BY DOING THE FOLLOWING:
BASLOAD "PROGRAMNAME.BASL"
RUN
  
.BAS.TXT ARE ASCII TEXT FILES OF BASIC PROGRAMS,
GENERALLY TYPED IN "OFF SYSTEM" (LIKE A PC OR MAC)
AS OPPOSED TO "ON SYSTEM" (OR "ON THE X16 SYSTEM").
X16 BASIC USES PETSCII RATHER THAN STANDARD ASCII.


WHERE APPLICABLE, THE .PRG VERSION IS THE TOKENIZED
BASIC VERSION OF THE CORRESPONDING .BAS SOURCE FILE.
THIS MEANS YOU CAN "EDIT" THE .BAS AND VIEW THEM,
BUT TO RUN THE PROGRAM YOU MUST LOAD THE .PRG AND THEN
TYPE RUN.
