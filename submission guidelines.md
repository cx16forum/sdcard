# Contributions

To submit your file for inclusion in the SD card library, please do the following:

  1. Create a Pull Request against this project. Your program should go in one of the SDCARD_ROOT directories, based on the type of program. ie: a game should go in /SDCARD_ROOT/GAMES/YOUR_GAME_NAME
  2. Include a README.TXT. The following items are _required_, and we will not release a program without them:
     a. Must include your name (common Internet handle or real name) and a method by which you can be contacted.
     b. Copyright information. This can be as simple as "(c) 2025 My Name name@email.com"
     c. A basic statement of what the program is and how to use it.

Basic requirements: 

  1. The program must work. It should be fully implemented and complete. If your program is a shareware style demo, the demo must still actually work, without major restrictions like time gating or delays forcing the user to look at "buy me" screens.
  2. All submissions must work with the 65C02 and 65C816 CPU with the latest _release_ ROM, on both hardware and the emulator. (Common sense exceptions will apply, such as programs that use the serial or MIDI ports.)
  3. The program must work on _at least_ VGA 40 column mode or 80 column mode. We would also like for it to work with composite mode, but that is not strictly required if this would inhibit basic functionality. (For example, a VT-102 terminal program should not be expected to work on a 64 column screen.)
  4. (pending) We are working on re-implementing a menu system. When the time comes, we will announce a metadata format for your program. When this happens, all submissions will require that the metadata be implemented if you want the program to be visible from the menu.
